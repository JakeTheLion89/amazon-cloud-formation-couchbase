# Marketplace

This template is used by the Couchbase Amazon Marketplace offer.  It is not intended to be used outside the marketplace.  Unless you are working on updates to the Couchbase Marketplace offer, you probably want to be using a different template.

## Select AMIs

For the base AMI we're using Amazon Linux 2017.09.  We're no longer building our bits into the AMI, instead it exists merely for tracking purposes.

## Clone AMIs

Send an email to aws-marketplace-seller-ops@amazon.com asking them to clone the AMI.  That will give an AMI for both Hourly Pricing and BYOL in every available region.  Even though the bits of all these AMIs are identical, there will be distinct AMI IDs for each one.

## Update Listings

There's a GUI to update listings but it doesn't support the new style offers yet.  As of now the best way to do this seems to be to mail Amazon and work through it manually.
